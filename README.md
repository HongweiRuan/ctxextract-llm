### Side Panel Information

1. Hole Information
Definition: A placeholder in the code, typically denoted as _(), _, or ??, marking incomplete parts of the code.
Purpose: Using language servers to analyze the AST, the specific node containing the hole is identified, along with its enclosing statement and type annotation.
Use: Facilitates type inference and ensures accurate code completion.

2. Relevant Types
Definition: All types related to the hole, including its components and subcomponents.
Purpose: Recursively extracts types down to primitive types, storing them in a type map.
Use: Provides a comprehensive type context for code completion.

3. Relevant Headers
Definition: Headers with types consistent with those derived from the hole.
Purpose: Uses type normalization to identify headers that match the holeâ€™s type.
Use: Supplies relevant code snippets to enhance the accuracy and contextual relevance of completions.
